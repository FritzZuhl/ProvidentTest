Hi Fritz,

 

Hope you are doing well. As promised, attached is the take-home assignment instructions and dataset. Please submit your source code along with a brief write-up of your findings by EOD next Friday, 12/17. Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on anything.

 

Thank you,
